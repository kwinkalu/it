        <h3 class="head2" id="headline">ABOUT NELSON MANDELA</h3>
        <p>     Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, 
        on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla 
        Mandela, principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. <br>
        In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of 
        Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.
        Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’ valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed 
        also of making his own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.

        <p>Although, Nelson Mandela died on the 5th of December 2013, his works of valour; its impact in not only 
        South Africa but other African countries can never be forgotten. He has inspired countless others with his 
        courage and endearing leadership. One of his quotes is "“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, 
        but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.”</p>
        <p>Nelson Mandela never wavered in his devotion to democracy, equality and learning. Despite terrible provocation,
        he never answered racism with racism. His life is an inspiration to all who are oppressed and deprived; and to all 
        who are opposed to oppression and deprivation.</p>
